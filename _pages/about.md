A software engineer and tech entrepreneur currently working towards my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca). I founded [GradYard](https://gradyard.substack.com) to bridge the gap between students and valuable research and internship opportunities. My professional experience spans roles at [Mitacs](https://www.mitacs.ca), [IIT(BHU)](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/), [Plumfind](https://www.plumfind.com/) and as a [Google Developer Student Clubs](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc) Lead. 

I thrive on creating impactful tech solutions, with a focus on software development and web applications. Iâ€™m passionate about mentoring aspiring technologists and sharing knowledge through content creation. Beyond my research and development work, I create daily vlogs that dive into tech, lifestyle, and startup culture.
